# TypeScript Examples

This repository is a collection of TypeScript files where various TypeScript features and properties are explored and demonstrated. The code is organized in the `src` folder, and the compiled output can be found in the `dist` folder.

## Introduction

TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. This repository serves as a playground to explore different TypeScript features and properties. It's an excellent resource for both beginners and experienced developers looking to deepen their understanding of TypeScript.

## File Structure

The project is structured as follows:

-   `src/`: This directory contains TypeScript source files.
-   `dist/`: This directory contains the compiled JavaScript files.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sachintom999/typescript-examples.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd typescript-examples
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies (if any):

    ```bash
    # You may not need to install any dependencies for this project.
    ```

4. Explore the TypeScript files in the `src` directory to learn about different TypeScript features and properties.

## Compilation

To compile the TypeScript files, make sure you have TypeScript installed globally or as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
# or
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

Once TypeScript is installed, you can use the following command to compile the TypeScript files:

```bash
tsc -b
```

This will compile the TypeScript code from the `src` directory and generate JavaScript files in the `dist` directory.
